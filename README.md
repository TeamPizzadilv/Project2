import scanner class

ask for user to give a password

use if else fuction- for the if password is valid it should print password is strong

then for else it should print password doesn't meet the requirement

then scanner can be closed as we are done taking inputs.

then use method void boolean to determine if the password is valid using tru or false.

if the length of the password is less then 8 then return must be longer than 8 charcaters

Then check if the password has a number and if the password has a character, should be set to false until check

create a string with the acceptable special charcters

if character is found then boolean has character is true and do the same for has digit

if both of the previous if else fuctions are true then return as both condition are met.

if not met return false
